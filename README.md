# Win10LockReplacement
A userland-based Windows 10 non-elevated minimally privilige dependant local user logon functionality replacement. Disables access to filesystem from user and ensures multiple programs that could be considered "private" stay closed.
# Why?
The Windows 10 default lock is heavily vulnerable and exploited, and this is a MUCH lesser known function that should be much less exploited. it is also simpler so that leaves out vulnerabilities. An exploit in most cases would have to be run after the fact, which would be very difficult to do. Also jsut a simple locking mechanism, not really made for security. Will protect you from your average joe though.
# DISCLAIMER
I am NOT responsible for neither anything you protect with this, nor what happens to it. Use this at your own risk. It was designed to be used in tandem with the default windows locking system anyway.
